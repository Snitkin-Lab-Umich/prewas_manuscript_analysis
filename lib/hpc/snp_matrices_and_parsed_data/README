Data was made by running clean_PROJECT_ID.R (specific for each project). These cleaning scripts renamed samples so that tree tips and snpmat names matched; they also removed low quality samples. The cleaning scripts were originally located in /nfs/esnitkin/Project_Prep_GWAS_Variants/Analysis/Prep_GWAS_SNPs/2019-11-20_clean_data/lib.

Example cleaning script: clean_Sa_1.R
