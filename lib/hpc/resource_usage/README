This directory contains the wrapper function used to call prewas in the various ways necessary for the resource usage plot. HPC-specific commands were used to track time and memory usage for each run. Data were collected and plotted in Figure S6.
Running the script write_sbat_files_to_run_prewas.R generates hpc jobs files for each combination of project, number of cores, whether or not the tree was provided, and the reference allele choice. One such hpc job file is: Sa_1_w_AR_w_tr_1.sbat.
