Files in this directory were written to enable plotting and to keep track of metadata for each project. There were all generated by either Katie, Zena, or Stephanie. 

Note: Originally, we intended to use 4 C. difficile datasets but only have datasets 3/4 available at the time of the preprint. By the time of the revision we decided not to add any more datasets so we simplified the naming scheme to remove unnecessarily confusing numbers. These changse are reflected in the project_names_and_colors.tsv
